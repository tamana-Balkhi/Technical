            <p>java is one of the most popular programming languages 
                out there. Released in 1995 and still widely used today,
                 Java has many applications, including software development, 
                 mobile applications, and large systems development. Knowing 
                 Java opens a lot of possibilities for you as a developer.</p>

            <header>Java history</header>
            <p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java 
                language project in June 1991. Java was originally designed for 
                interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable
                 television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, the coffee from Indonesia.
                  Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.</p>
            <p>Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.
             It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times
              on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed 
              network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the
             ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular.
             The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly
             with the Java 1.0 language specification.[28] With the advent of Java 2
            (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 â€“ 1999), new versions had multiple 
            configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and
            APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME
            featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed
            J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE,
            Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.</p>
            <p>In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later
             the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.
              Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process</p>

                <p>here we will learn about the syntax of java: </p>
                <code>
                   MyClass.java <br>
                    public class Main {<br>
                        public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                          System.out.println("Hello World");
                        }
                      }
                </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Java_Variables">
            <header>Java Variables</header>
            <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
            <p>In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="var">String</span> - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes</li>
                <li><span class="var">int</span> - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
                <li><span class="var">float</span> - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99></li>
                <li><span class="var">char</span> - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
                <li><span class="var">boolean</span> - stores values with two states: true or false</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Declaring (Creating) Variables</h3>
            <p>To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:</p>
            <h4>Syntax</h4>
            <code> type variable = value;</code>
            <h3>example</h3>
            <code>String name = "Ahmad";<br>
                    System.out.println(name);</code>

        <section id="The_main_Method" class="main-section">
            <header>The main Method</header>
            <p>The  <span style="color: red">main()</span> method is required and you will see it in every Java program:</p>
            <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>

      <section  class="main-section" id="Java_Conditions_and_If_Statements">
          <header>Java Conditions and If Statements</header>
          <p>Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Less than: a < b </li>
              <li> Less than or equal to: a <= b </li>
              <li>Greater than: a > b</li> 
               <li> Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
               <li> Equal to a == b</li>
               <li> Not Equal to: a != b</li>
          </ul>
           <p>You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.</p><br>
           <h3> Java has the following conditional statements:</h3>
           <li>Use <span class="var">if</span>  to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true </li>
           <li>Use <span class="var">else</span> to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>  
           <li>Use <span class="var">else</span> if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
          <li> Use <span class="var">switch</span> to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</li></li>
        <h2>The if Statement</h2>
        <p>Use the <strong>if</strong> statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is <strong>true</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <code>if (condition) {
              }</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Java_Methods">
          <header>Java Methods</header>
          <p>A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.</p>
          <p>You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.</p>  
          <p>Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.</p>  
          <p> Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Create_a_Method">
          <header>Create a Method</header>
          <p>A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses (). Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as <span class="var">System.out.println()</span> , 
              but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:</p>
              <h3>example</h3>
              <code>
                    public class Main { <br>
                        static void myMethod() { <br>
                        }
                    }
